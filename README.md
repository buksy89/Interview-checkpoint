# Interview-checkpoint
To an extent am ready but i still need to improve myself.
I want to thank GoMyCode for the platform to learn from more espacially my instructor Mr. Yusuf Momoh for given us his time energy and everything to see i understand thank you sir.
The skills i gain during the Bootcamp they were good but some are confusing, since i have gotten the basic i will build on it and i know at the end i will reach the top. Thank you so much GoMyCode.
